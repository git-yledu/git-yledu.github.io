Because both [Bernardo
Kastrup](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/2013/04/why-materialism-is-baloney-overview.html) and [Richard Dawkins](https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Reality-Know-Whats-Really/dp/1451675046) are right.

Read [Eisenstein](https://ascentofhumanity.com/) : probably the best summary of our global
condition.

The way our ancestors viewed and felt the world is forever gone. Non-civilized humans are fast
disappearing, their habitat being slowly but certainly destroyed. The civilized human condition is
not to be dreamed, but to be lived and hopefully driven.

## Why write ?

Because I want to share my thoughts, and sharing is the force that pulls thoughts out of the void.

_Sharing is to thought what the event horizon is to a singularity : this is where thought radiates._

## Me

Yes, I'm a physicist, of the ideal materialist kind.

## Programming

As for programming languages I use anything physicists use plus :
